    <h1>Computer Viruses</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Computer viruses come in many shapes and sizes, with danger levels ranging from harmless to devastating.  
            The purpose of this website is to provide a general overview of certain types of computer viruses.
        </p>

        <h2 id="worms">Worms</h2>
        <p class="overview"><em>Worms are viruses that are able to self-replicate.  While not inherently malicious, they 
            are built to be incredibly pervasive and undetectable.  The term "virus" is probably used due to the nature of 
            how these computer worms distribute themselves.</em>
        </p>
        <h4>Creeper</h4>
        <p class="description">Creeper is known as the first computer virus.  During the developer of the internet (or rather, 
            ARPANET), Bob Thomas created Creeper, a program that would send itself across the network, duplicate itself, 
            display a message, and repeat the process.  The message it displayed said, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" 
            While not malicious, Creeper demonstrated the potential damage that could be done with a more sophisticated and 
            wicked program.
        </p>
        <h4>Elk Cloner</h4>
        <p class="description">Created by high school student Richard Skrenta, Elk Cloner would replicate itself across Apple II 
            computers.  He originally created to prank his friends, but it also showed how invasive a virus can be.  
            It was incredibly elusive, displaying the following message only every 50th time the computer would 
            boot up:

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="ransomware">Ransomware</h2>
        <p class="overview"><em>Ransomware is most often used to describe viruses that encrypt the target's files, rendering them 
            unusable.  In order for the target to decrypt their files, they must pay the attacker a ransom.
        </em>
        </p>
        <h4>WannaCry?</h4>
        <p class="description">WannaCry is actually an example of both a worm and ransomware.  Because of a vulnerability in the 
            SMB protocol for Windows computers (EternalBlue), WannaCry was able to send itself between computers.  It would 
            encrypt files on the target host, display a message requesting around $300 in bitcoin in return for decrypting the files, 
            then send itself somewhere else.  The Windows vulnerability has since been patched, but any older versions of Windows 
            are still vulnerable.
        </p>
        <div class="centerimage">
            <img src="images/wannacry.png" alt="WannaCry Message" class="change-opacity">
        </div>
        <h4>Robbinhood</h4>
        <p class="description">Robbinhood is an interesting example of ransomware.  When the program reaches the target, it looks for specific configurations 
            on the computer to make sure the attack is possible.  If not, it deletes itself.  Upon verifying that the attack can in fact be done, it disables 
            all antivirus software it can.  It then forces all files to close so it can encrypt them.  After encrypting, a message pops up saying 
            <em>Done, Enjoy buddy :)))</em>  Similarly to WannaCry, a file is left on the computer that requests a Bitcoin ransom in return for decrypting the 
            files.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="spyware">Spyware</h2>
        <p class="overview"><em>Spyware can refer to a wide variety of viruses, but the thing they all have in common is that 
            they collect information about the target.  Examples of spyware include keyloggers, trojans, and web trackers.
        </em>
        </p>
        <h4>DarkHotel</h4>
        <p class="description">DarkHotel was an interesting form of spyware.  It would piggyback off of hotel wifi networks, attempting to infect anyone 
            using the public network.  When someone would log in, it would prompt them to update their Adobe software.  If the target accepted, a keylogging 
            program would be installed on the device.  The keylogger would listen for credentials such as usernames and passwords and then send them back to 
            the attacker.
        </p>
        <h4>BonziBuddy</h4>
        <p class="description">One of the earliest examples of spyware was called BonziBuddy.  Around the early 2000s, personal software 
            assistants were growing popular.  BonziBuddy was one of the more popular software assistants because of how 
            friendly and fun it seemed.  However, what those who downloaded BonziBuddy didn't know was that it was actually spyware, 
            extracting personal information through a keylogger to develop more targeted ads.  Before long, thousands of computers were 
            infected with this monkey spyware.  It's interesting to me that collecting personal information has become commonplace in 
            the modern day...
